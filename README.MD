# Spring-addons

Set of tools I find useful to work with Spring-framework.
For now it is focused on spring-security with OAuth2, but could grow.

As I write this, latest `springaddons.version` is `2.4.0` but I could forget to update before releasing, so please refer to https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/c4-soft/springaddons/spring-addons/ to pick latest available release of one of the following:

## modules

### [`spring-security-oauth2-addons`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-security-oauth2-addons)

Some extensions to Spring OAuth2 that could be of use at runtime (not solely tests) such as:

- new `Authentication` implementations (`OidcIdAuthenticationToken` for instance)
- builders for `Jwt`, `BearerTokenAuthentication`, ...
- base classes for Keycloak authentication configuration

### [`spring-security-oauth2-test-addons`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-security-oauth2-test-addons)

Code common to webmvc and webflux test libs. This includes annotations, very useful as it allows to tests not only `@Controller` but also any other kind of `@Component` (such as `@Service`): `@WithMockAuthentication`, `@WithMockKeycloakAuth` and `@WithMockOidcId`

### [`spring-security-oauth2-test-webflux-addons`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-security-oauth2-test-webflux-addons)

Focus on reactive tests with

- "fluent" API for `WebTestClient`
- some tooling around `WebTestClient`: configurable default media-type and charset, requests shortcuts

### [`spring-security-oauth2-test-webmvc-addons`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-security-oauth2-test-webmvc-addons)

Focus on servlet tests with

- "fluent" API for `MockMvc`
- some tooling around `MockMvc`: configurable default media-type and charset, requests shortcuts

## Sample applications

I put quite a few spring-boot app samples in [`spring-security-oauth2-test-webmvc-addons`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-security-oauth2-test-webmvc-addons/src/test/java/com/c4_soft/springaddons/samples/webmvc) and [`spring-security-oauth2-test-webflux-addons`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-security-oauth2-test-webflux-addons/src/test/java/com/c4_soft/springaddons/samples/webflux).

The reason why samples are in test sources (under `src/test` folders) is to keep jar small. It can, of course, be run / debug from within your favorite IDE.

I recommand you clone my repo and debug the samples with a REST client like Postman, so that you can hack the config and tests.
Adapting the samples to your Keycloak instance should be just a matter of editing `application.properties`.

**Caveat** do not narrow your exploration to `keycloak` sample just beacause you are using a Keycloak authorization-server:
I run all samples against a Keycloak instance.

Last, `*RetrievingAuthoritiesFromDatabase` samples retrieve authorities from a DB instead of extracting it from JWT claims. The key in the DB is the user "subject".
In that case, Keycloak authorisation-server is responsible for ensuring user ID only, authorities are the responsibility of the resource-server.
As a consequence, (to run only, not in unit-tests) those samples expect a database to be accessible and populated, which I can't do for you
as I can't know the "subject" claims for your test users registered in your Keycloak instance.

## Java version

[11 or higher](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/6040991746d9dfef6bb72d871fef86c9aff3d687/pom.xml#L46). I've been asked to port this lib to Java 8. I won't. Java 8 was release in early 2014, more than 6 years ago, langage and JDK have improved and I use some of recent collections and stream APIs.

## `keycloak-spring-boot-starter` & `keycloak-spring-security-adapter` version

If using Keycloak with version >= `9.0.2` and < `11.0.0`, you need to add following bean to your conf because of a [regression](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KEYCLOAK-14020):

```java
    @Configuration
	public class SpringBootKeycloakConfigResolver implements KeycloakConfigResolver {

		private KeycloakDeployment keycloakDeployment;

		private AdapterConfig adapterConfig;

		@Autowired
		public SpringBootKeycloakConfigResolver(AdapterConfig adapterConfig) {
			this.adapterConfig = adapterConfig;
		}

		@Override
		public KeycloakDeployment resolve(OIDCHttpFacade.Request request) {
			if (keycloakDeployment != null) {
				return keycloakDeployment;
			}

			keycloakDeployment = KeycloakDeploymentBuilder.build(adapterConfig);

			return keycloakDeployment;
		}
	}
```

From 11.0.0 on, just `@Import(KeycloakSpringBootConfigResolver.class)` with `@KeycloakConfiguration` on your `KeycloakWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` implementation.

## Release notes

2.0 comes with a noticeable amount of breaking changes. So lets start tracking features.

### 2.4.0

- rename `ServletKeycloakAuthUnitTestingSupport::keycloakAuthenticationToken()` to `authentication()` to improve API fluidity (`api.with(keycloak.authentication()).get(...)`)

### 2.3.0

- implementation closer to [open ID specs](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html): split claims into `@IdTokenClaims` and `@OidcStandardClaims`
- re-use OIDC ID annotations into `@WithMockKeycloakAuth`

### 2.2.0

- `OidcId::getName()` returns `subject` claim instead of `preferred_username`
- replace `name` with `subject` in `@WithMockOidcId`
- replace `name` from `@WithMockKeycloakAuth` with `preferedUsername` in `@WithAccessToken`
- support for private claims in `@WithMockOidcId` and `@WithMockKeycloakAuth` (claims with values of type `int`, `long`, `String` and `String[]` only)
- add missing subject claim in Keycloak access and ID tokens
- compose `@WithAccessToken` with `@WithKeycloakIDToken` instead of repeting properties (`AccessToken` extends `IDToken`)
- add advanced `@WithMockKeycloakAuth` sample usage in [`spring-security-oauth2-test-addons` README](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-security-oauth2-test-addons)

### 2.1.0

- fix Keycloak typo (was wrongly spelled Keycloack at many places)
- add samples with authrities retieved from a DB instead of the JWT for both OidcIdAuthenticationToken and JwtAuthenticationToken
- add sample involving `keycloak-spring-boot-starter` and `keycloak-spring-security-adapter`

### 2.0.0

These release is still focused on unit-testing Spring OAuth2 applications

- `@WithMockAuthentication` annotation along with `mockAuthentication()` servlet (webmvc) and reactive (webflux) flow APIs. You choose the `Authentication` type, the framework feeds the security context with a Mockito mock. This is dead simple but should cover 99% of test cases. I wonder why I didn't think of it sooner...
- Focus solely on adding to Spring `Authentication` implementations and tests tooling (no more alternatives, with an exception for `OidcId` which overlaps Spring's `OidcIdToken`)
- Split `webmvc` (servlets) and `webflux` (reactive) code in distinct libs to ease dependency management
- Re-shuffle packages and jars (less code, less jars, more expressive package names)
- WIP: Extensives samples and tests. Samples are boot apps under `src/test` to keep jars small
- Use Keycloak as authorisation-server for all resource-server samples, each of which configuring a specific `Authentication` impl

Note that I chose Keycloak because it's a feature reach, easy to setup authorisation-server.
It should not be much of an effort to migrate sample resource-servers to another one, with an exception of those using `KeycloakAuthenticationToken` as authentication impl, of course.
